| Pol. Major General Dr. Szilvia Tomin |

It's an internal security government agency.

Unlike more traditional ingelligence services, such as counter-espionage, the
NVSZ operates mainly as an internal affairs and anti-corruption organization. It
was established in 2011 and operates under the Hungarian Ministry of Interior.

Its key responsibilities include:
- **anti-corruption**: its main mission is to prevent, detect and investigate
  crimes of corruption, abuse of office and influence peddling *(traffico di
  influenze)* committed by government personnel;
- **internal control**: it acts as an internal control body for a wide range of
  state agencies, known as "protected organizations";
- **information gathering**, including covert data collection, specifically
  targeted at crime prevention within state institutions.

The internal control function is achieved with mechanisms such as:
1. **integrity testing**, it's authorized to conduct tests to assess reliability
   and loyalty of public employees and law enforcement members, often using
   simulated scenarios to test their reaction to corruption attempts;
1. **lifestyle monitoring**, a proactive monitoring function, in fact the NVSZ
   is authorized to monitor the lifestyles of officers and public servants to
   see if they are living "beyond their means".

It also has a **protection** function, meaning it provides physical protection
and takes action if a member of the "protected staff" (or their family) is
threatened, attacked, or targeted as a result of performing their official
duties.

## Italian National Anticorruption Authority *(ANAC)*

| [*Autorità Nazionale Anticorruzione*][anac] |

| President |
| :-: |
| Giuseppe Busia |

It is an independent Italian administrative authority. Its main task is to
prevent corruption within the public administration, ensure transparency and
impartiality of public officials, and supervise the proper execution of public
contracts.

Therefore the key points about it are:
- **corruption prevention**: it develops strategies and National Anti-Corruption
  Plans that individual public administrations must adopt;
- **transparency**: it ensures that public administrations publish data and
  documents (such as budgets, executive salaries, tender procedures *(procedure
  di gara)*) to make them accessible to citizens;
- **public contracts**: it oversees the entire public procurement sector to
  ensure that procedures are legal, fair, and not subject to criminal
  infiltration or corruption. It manages the National Database of Public
  Contracts *(BDNCP)*;
- **powers**: it has regulatory powers (issuing guidelines), supervisory powers,
  and the power to impose sanctions in cases of violations of transparency or
  procurement rules;
- **whistleblowing**: it manages reports of wrongdoing (known as whistleblowing)
  from public employees, guaranteeing their confidentiality.

| Rector |
| :-: |
| Dr. Gergely Deli |

It's a specialized, state-run institution and serves as the primary educational
and research center for public service and state-building[^1].

Its core mission is to educate and train professionals for careers in public
administration, law enforcement, the military, and international affairs. It
also has a unique, specialized focus on water sciences.

The university's academic structure is built around its distinct professional
fields. Its main faculties include:
- **Faculty of Public Governance and International Studies** (FPGIS): focuses on
  training civil servants and diplomats. Programs often cover international
  relations, public management, and european studies;
- **Faculty of Military Sciences and Officer Training** (FMSOT): educates the
  next generation of professional officers for the Hungarian Defence Forces;
- **Faculty of Law Enforcement** (FLE): provides training for police officers
  and other law enforcement personnel, with specializations in areas like
  criminal investigation, economic crime, and border policing;
- **Faculty of Water Sciences** (FWS): a unique faculty (located in Baja,
  Hungary) dedicated to water diplomacy, water resource management, and civil
  engineering related to water.

While the modern university was officially founded in 2012 (through the merger
of several existing institutions), it traces its heritage to the Royal Hungarian
Ludovika Academy. This original military academy was founded in 1808.

The university's main Ludovika Campus in Budapest is a prominent landmark,
featuring the fully restored historic academy building alongside modern
educational and sporting facilities.
