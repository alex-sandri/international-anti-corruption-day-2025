> [!INFO]
>
> 📄 [UN Charter](assets/pdf/uncharter.pdf).

It's an intergovernmental organization **founded in 1945**, just after the end
of World War II. It was established by 51 original member countries with the
primary mission of maintaining international peace and security.

Today, it comprises 193 Member States — nearly every country in the world. Its
headquarters are in New York City, with main offices in Geneva, Nairobi, and
Vienna.

The UN's work is guided by the purposes and principles contained in its founding
document, the UN Charter.

The United Nations' activities are focused on four main pillars:
1. **maintaining peace and security**: this is the UN's most well-known role. It
   includes:
   - peacekeeping: deploying neutral military and police personnel (known as
     "Blue Helmets" or "Blue Berets") to conflict zones to monitor ceasefires
     and protect civilians;
   - conflict prevention: using diplomacy and mediation to stop disputes from
     escalating into war;
   - peacebuilding: helping countries transition from conflict to peace through
     rebuilding institutions and supporting reconciliation.
1. **protecting human rights**: the UN is the global guardian of human rights.
   It created the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948), a milestone
   document that sets out fundamental rights to be universally protected. It
   monitors human rights situations worldwide and speaks out against violations;
1. **delivering humanitarian aid**: when a disaster, famine, or conflict
   strikes, the UN coordinates the global response. Agencies like the World Food
   Programme (WFP) and UNICEF (Children's Fund) provide food, water, shelter,
   and medical care to millions of people in need. The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR)
   protects people who have been forced to flee their homes;
1. **promoting sustainable development and climate action**: it works to improve
   people's lives and protect the planet. Its current agenda is the 17
   Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a plan adopted by all members in 2015.
   These goals are a call to action to end poverty, improve health and
   education, reduce inequality, and combat climate change by 2030.

   Combating corruption is part of the 16th SDG **"Peace, Justice and Strong
   Institutions"**, with some targets explicitly aiming at its reduction:
   - `4` «*By 2030, significantly reduce illicit financial and arms flows,
     strengthen the recovery and return of stolen assets and combat all forms of
     organized crime*»;
   - `5` «*Substantially reduce corruption and bribery in all their forms*»;
   - `6` «*Develop effective, accountable and transparent institutions at all
     levels*»;
   - `10` «*Ensure public access to information and protect fundamental
     freedoms, in accordance with national legislation and international
     agreements*».

The United Nations is structured around six principal organs, each with a
distinct role:
1. **General Assembly** (UNGA) *(Assemblea Generale)*, the UN's main
   deliberative and policymaking body. It is composed of all 193 Member States,
   each with one vote. It discusses and makes recommendations on all matters
   covered by the UN Charter;
2. **Security Council** (UNSC) *(Consiglio di Sicurezza)*, the UN's most
   powerful body, with primary responsibility for maintaining international
   peace and security. It has 15 members:
   - <u>5 permanent members</u> (P5): China, France, the Russian Federation, the
     United Kingdom, and the United States. These five countries have the power
     to veto any major resolution;
   - <u>10 non-permanent members</u>, elected by the General Assembly for
     two-year terms.
3. **Economic and Social Council** (ECOSOC) *(Consiglio Economico e Sociale)*,
   it focuses on economic, social, and environmental issues. It coordinates the
   work of the UN's many specialized agencies, such as the World Health
   Organization (WHO) and UNESCO;
4. **International Court of Justice** (ICJ) *(Corte Internazionale di
   Giustizia)*, located in The Hague, Netherlands, this is the UN's principal
   judicial organ. Its role is to settle legal disputes between states and give
   advisory opinions on legal questions;
5. **Secretariat** *(Segretariato)*, it's the "civil service" of the UN,
   carrying out the day-to-day work of the organization. It is led by the
   Secretary-General, who is the chief administrative officer and a global
   symbol of the UN's ideals;
6. **Trusteeship Council** *(Consiglio di Amministrazione Fiduciaria)*, it was
   established to supervise 11 "Trust Territories" as they transitioned to
   independence. Having completed its mission, it **suspended operations** in
   1994.

### [United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime][unodc] (UNODC)

| 🇮🇹 |
| :-: |
| *Ufficio delle Nazioni Unite sulla Droga e il Crimine* |

| Executive Director |
| :-: |
| Ghada Waly |

It's a United Nations office dedicated to addressing the interrelated issues of
illicit drugs, transnational organized crime, corruption, and terrorism. It
serves as the global leader in these areas, mandated to assist Member States in
making the world safer from these threats.

It was established in 1997.

Its headquarters are in Vienna, Austria, and it operates through an extensive
network of field offices worldwide.

The mission of the UNODC is to contribute to global peace and security, human
rights, and development. It achieves this through three main pillars of work:
1. research and analysis: it conducts extensive global research to monitor and
   analyze drug and crime trends. Its most famous publication is the annual
   World Drug Report, which provides a comprehensive assessment of the
   international drug problem. This research helps to identify emerging threats
   and provide an evidence base for policy;
1. normative work (policy and treaties): it works to help countries ratify and
   implement key international treaties. It serves as the guardian of crucial UN
   conventions, including:
   - the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC) and its
     protocols (on human trafficking, migrant smuggling, and firearms);
   - the [UN Convention against
     Corruption](#united-nations-convention-against-corruption-uncac) (UNCAC);
   - the three international drug control conventions.
1. technical cooperation (field operations): it provides practical,
   on-the-ground technical assistance and capacity-building to Member States.
   This includes:
   - training police officers, border guards, prosecutors, and judges;
   - helping to reform justice and prison systems;
   - supporting drug use prevention, treatment, and care programs;
   - developing sustainable alternative livelihoods for farmers who cultivate
     illicit crops.

The UNODC focuses its efforts on several key areas:
- **countering organized crime**: this includes fighting human trafficking
  (promoted through its Blue Heart Campaign), migrant smuggling, wildlife and
  forest crime, and firearms trafficking;
- **addressing the world drug problem**: this involves efforts in drug use
  prevention and treatment, as well as countering illicit drug trafficking and
  production;
- **fighting corruption**: it's the lead UN entity for anti-corruption, helping
  countries implement the [UN Convention against
  Corruption](#united-nations-convention-against-corruption-uncac) (UNCAC);
- **terrorism prevention**: it works to strengthen the capacity of national
  criminal justice systems to prevent and counter terrorism in compliance with
  the rule of law;
- **crime prevention and criminal justice**: this area focuses on improving
  access to justice, promoting prison reform, and preventing violence.

#### [United Nations Convention Against Corruption][uncac] (UNCAC)

> [!INFO]
>
> 📄 [PDF](assets/pdf/UN_Convention_Against_Corruption.pdf).

It's the only legally binding, universal anti-corruption treaty. It provides a
comprehensive framework for member states to prevent and combat corruption in
both the public and private sectors.

It was adopted on October 31, 2003 by the United Nations General Assembly. It
was later signed on December 9, 2003 and entered into force on December 14,
2005\. Italy ratified it with the *Law 116/2009*.

> This Convention shall be open to all States for signature from 9 to 11
> December 2003 in **Merida, Mexico**, and thereafter at United Nations
> Headquarters in **New York** until 9 December 2005.
>
> <small><i>~ art. 67, par. 1 UNCAC</i></small>

It's subdiveded into eight chapters:
1. **General provisions**;

   - *"Preventive anti-corruption body or bodies" (art. 6)*;
   - *"Codes of conduct for public officials" (art. 8)*;
   - *"Public procurement and management of public finances" (art. 9)*.
1. **Criminalization and law enforcement**:

   - *"Law enforcement cooperation" (art. 48)*.
1. **Asset recovery**, it establishes the principle that **stolen assets should
   be returned to their country of origin**;
1. **Technical assistance and information exchange**, this chapter ensures that
   countries, particularly developing nations, receive the support they need to
   implement the Convention. This includes:
   - providing training and technical assistance for law enforcement, judiciary,
     and anti-corruption agencies;
   - sharing best practices, research, and information on how to effectively
     combat corruption.
1. **Mechanisms for implementation**:
   - *"Conference of the States Parties to the Convention" (art. 63)*, its main
     goal is to improve the capacity of countries to implement the Convention
     and to promote cooperation among them.
1. **Final provisions**.

It has been ratified by most UN member states, with 192 parties, giving it
near-universal adherence.

The [UN Office on Drugs and
Crime](#united-nations-office-on-drugs-and-crime-unodc) (UNODC) serves as the
secretariat for the Convention.

#### [Global Operational Network of Anti-Corruption Law Enforcement Authorities][globe-network]

<img src="assets/img/globe-network.png" alt="Logo" height="80px">

The **GlobE Network** was established in 2021 as a G20 initiative and is
supported by the [United Nations Office on Drugs and
Crime](#united-nations-office-on-drugs-and-crime-unodc), which provides its
secretariat.

Its primary goal is to make transnational cooperation faster and more effective.
It does this by creating a secure and trusted environment where anti-corruption
officials from different countries can directly contact and cooperate with each
other.

Its main functions include:
- **facilitating informal cooperation**: it helps law enforcement authorities to
  quickly and informally share information, intelligence, and best practices to
  advance investigations;
- **case-specific support**: it provides a secure communication platform for
  practitioners to coordinate on specific cross-border corruption cases, helping
  to track, investigate, and prosecute offenders;
- **asset recovery**: a key focus is to assist in the recovery of stolen assets
  that have been moved to other jurisdictions.

## Hungary's National Protective Service *(NVSZ)*

<img src="assets/img/nvsz.png" alt="Logo" height="80px">

| 🇮🇹 | 🇭🇺 |
| :-: | :-: |
| *Servizio Nazionale di Protezione dell'Ungheria* | [*Nemzeti Védelmi Szolgálat*][nvsz] |

| Director General |
| :-: |
| Pol. Major General Dr. Szilvia Tomin |

It's an internal security government agency.

Unlike more traditional ingelligence services, such as counter-espionage, the
NVSZ operates mainly as an internal affairs and anti-corruption organization. It
was established in 2011 and operates under the Hungarian Ministry of Interior.

Its key responsibilities include:
- **anti-corruption**: its main mission is to prevent, detect and investigate
  crimes of corruption, abuse of office and influence peddling *(traffico di
  influenze)* committed by government personnel;
- **internal control**: it acts as an internal control body for a wide range of
  state agencies, known as "protected organizations";
- **information gathering**, including covert data collection, specifically
  targeted at crime prevention within state institutions.

The internal control function is achieved with mechanisms such as:
1. **integrity testing**, it's authorized to conduct tests to assess reliability
   and loyalty of public employees and law enforcement members, often using
   simulated scenarios to test their reaction to corruption attempts;
1. **lifestyle monitoring**, a proactive monitoring function, in fact the NVSZ
   is authorized to monitor the lifestyles of officers and public servants to
   see if they are living "beyond their means".

It also has a **protection** function, meaning it provides physical protection
and takes action if a member of the "protected staff" (or their family) is
threatened, attacked, or targeted as a result of performing their official
duties.

## Italian National Anticorruption Authority *(ANAC)*

<img src="assets/img/anac.png" alt="Logo" height="80px">

| 🇮🇹 |
| :-: |
| [*Autorità Nazionale Anticorruzione*][anac] |

| President |
| :-: |
| Dr. Giuseppe Busia |

It is an independent Italian administrative authority. Its main task is to
prevent corruption within the public administration, ensure transparency and
impartiality of public officials, and supervise the proper execution of public
contracts.

Therefore the key points about it are:
- **corruption prevention**: it develops strategies and National Anti-Corruption
  Plans that individual public administrations must adopt;
- **transparency**: it ensures that public administrations publish data and
  documents (such as budgets, executive salaries, tender procedures *(procedure
  di gara)*) to make them accessible to citizens;
- **public contracts**: it oversees the entire public procurement sector to
  ensure that procedures are legal, fair, and not subject to criminal
  infiltration or corruption. It manages the National Database of Public
  Contracts *(BDNCP)*;
- **powers**: it has regulatory powers (issuing guidelines), supervisory powers,
  and the power to impose sanctions in cases of violations of transparency or
  procurement rules;
- **whistleblowing**: it manages reports of wrongdoing (known as whistleblowing)
  from public employees, guaranteeing their confidentiality.

## Guardia di Finanza's Special Anti-Corruption Unit

| 🇮🇹 |
| :-: |
| *Nucleo Speciale Anticorruzione della Guardia di Finanza* |

| Commander |
| :-: |
| Brigadier General Giovanni Salerno |

It's a specialized department of the Guardia di Finanza (GdiF), which is Italy's
financial police force.

While [ANAC](#italian-national-anticorruption-authority-anac) is an independent
administrative authority focused primarily on prevention and regulation, the
GdiF's Special Anti-Corruption Unit is a judicial police body focused on the
repression of crimes.

Its main tasks are:
- **complex investigations**: it conducts judicial police investigations focused
  on serious crimes against the Public Administration, such as corruption,
  extortion by a public official, embezzlement[^1] *(appropriazione indebita)*,
  and abuse of office;
- **ANAC's operational arm**: it acts as the primary investigative arm for ANAC.
  When ANAC, during its administrative monitoring activities, identifies facts
  that may constitute a crime, it reports them to the Public Prosecutor's Office
  and relies on the Special Anti-Corruption Unit for the criminal investigation;
- **public spending oversight**: it carries out checks and investigations into
  the illicit use of public funds, including both national and EU funds;
- **collaboration with prosecutors**: it works closely with the Public
  Prosecutor's offices and the National Anti-Mafia and Anti-Terrorism
  Directorate *(DNAA)* on the most significant corruption-related
  investigations.

Its relationship with ANAC is detailed in a special *memorandum* of
understanding *(protocollo d'intesa)*.

It's a specialized, state-run institution and serves as the primary educational
and research center for public service and state-building[^2].

Its core mission is to educate and train professionals for careers in public
administration, law enforcement, the military, and international affairs. It
also has a unique, specialized focus on water sciences.

The university's academic structure is built around its distinct professional
fields. Its main faculties include:
- **Faculty of Public Governance and International Studies** (FPGIS): focuses on
  training civil servants and diplomats. Programs often cover international
  relations, public management, and european studies;
- **Faculty of Military Sciences and Officer Training** (FMSOT): educates the
  next generation of professional officers for the Hungarian Defence Forces;
- **Faculty of Law Enforcement** (FLE): provides training for police officers
  and other law enforcement personnel, with specializations in areas like
  criminal investigation, economic crime, and border policing;
- **Faculty of Water Sciences** (FWS): a unique faculty (located in Baja,
  Hungary) dedicated to water diplomacy, water resource management, and civil
  engineering related to water.

While the modern university was officially founded in 2012 (through the merger
of several existing institutions), it traces its heritage to the Royal Hungarian
Ludovika Academy. This original military academy was founded in 1808.

The university's main Ludovika Campus in Budapest is a prominent landmark,
featuring the fully restored historic academy building alongside modern
educational and sporting facilities.

## [International Anti-Corruption Academy][iaca] (IACA)

| Dean and Executive Secretary |
| :-: |
| Professor Slagjana Taseva |

It's based in Laxenburg, Austria, just south of Vienna.

It was launched in 2010 and became a formal international organization on March
8, 2011.

The Academy was initiated by a partnership including the [United Nations Office
on Drugs and Crime](#united-nations-office-on-drugs-and-crime-unodc) (UNODC),
INTERPOL, the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), and the Republic of Austria.

Its constituency includes over 70 UN Member States and several international
organizations.

It's an international, intergovernmental organization and a post-secondary
educational institution. It is the first global institution of its kind with a
mandate dedicated exclusively to a comprehensive approach to fighting
corruption.

IACA's primary mission is to overcome the current shortcomings in
anti-corruption knowledge and practice. It aims to empower professionals and
practitioners from all sectors to effectively implement the
[UNCAC](#united-nations-convention-against-corruption-uncac).

IACA's work is centered around three main **pillars**:
1. **academic degree programmes**, it offers postgraduate programs, including a
   Master in Anti-Corruption Studies (MACS) and an International Master in
   Anti-Corruption Compliance (IMACC). These programs are designed for
   professionals from the public and private sectors, as well as from civil
   society and academia;
1. **professional training**:
   - tailor-made trainings: customized programs for specific organizations,
     governments, or companies;
   - open trainings: standardized courses and workshops on various
     anti-corruption and compliance topics;
   - online courses: A mix of instructor-led and self-paced courses available to
     a global audience.
1. **research and networking**, the Academy serves as a think-tank, conducting
   research on corruption and compliance trends. It hosts international
   conferences, webinars, and events, creating a global network for
   anti-corruption experts to share best practices and challenges.

## [Group of States against Corruption][greco] *(GRECO)*

<img src="assets/img/greco.png" alt="Logo" height="80px">

| 🇮🇹 | 🇫🇷 |
| :-: | :-: |
| *Gruppo di Stati contro la corruzione* | *Groupe d'Etats contre la corruption* |

It was established in 1999 by the **Council of Europe** to monitor States'
compliance with the organisation's anti-corruption standards.

GRECO's objective is to improve the capacity of its members to fight corruption
by monitoring their compliance with Council of Europe anti-corruption standards
through a dynamic process of mutual evaluation and peer pressure. It helps to
identify deficiencies in national anti-corruption policies, prompting the
necessary legislative, institutional and practical reforms. GRECO also provides
a platform for the sharing of best practice in the prevention and detection of
corruption.

## [Transparency International][ti]

<img src="assets/img/ti.png" alt="Logo" height="80px">

It's a global non-governmental organization (NGO) dedicated to combating
corruption. It is one of the world's most prominent anti-corruption
organizations.

Founded in 1993 and headquartered in Berlin, Germany, it operates as a global
movement with a network of independent national chapters in over 100 countries.

> **Vision**
>
> To see a world in which government, politics, business, civil society, and the
> daily lives of people are free of corruption.

> **Mission**
>
> To stop corruption and promote transparency, accountability, and integrity at
> all levels and across all sectors of society.

It does not investigate or expose individual cases of corruption. Instead, it
focuses on systemic issues and long-term solutions. Its main activities include:
- **advocacy**: pushing for national and international anti-corruption reforms,
  laws, and conventions (such as the
  [UNCAC](#united-nations-convention-against-corruption-uncac));
- **research and publications**: producing influential reports, indexes, and
  tools that measure and highlight corruption;
- **building coalitions**: working with governments, businesses, and other civil
  society groups to implement anti-corruption measures;
- **empowering citizens**: running Advocacy and Legal Advice Centres (ALACs) in
  many countries, which provide free and confidential legal advice to witnesses
  and victims of corruption.

It's best known for its two main annual reports:
1. **Corruption Perceptions Index** (CPI): this is TI's flagship publication. It
   is one of the most widely used indicators of public sector corruption
   worldwide.

   It ranks 180 countries and territories by their perceived levels of public
   sector corruption.

   It is a "composite index" that aggregates data from numerous surveys and
   assessments of corruption, as **perceived by business executives and country
   experts**.

   It uses a scale of 0 to 100, where 100 is "very clean" and 0 is
   "highly corrupt";
2. **Global Corruption Barometer** (GCB), unlike the CPI, which relies on expert
   opinion, it **surveys ordinary citizens**.

   It asks for citizens' direct, personal experiences with corruption in their
   daily lives (e.g., "Have you paid a bribe in the last 12 months?").

   It is the world's largest public opinion survey on corruption, providing a
   "ground-level" view of how corruption affects people and which institutions
   they perceive as most corrupt.

| Italy 🇮🇹 | Hungary 🇭🇺 |
| :-: | :-: |
| [ANAC](#italian-national-anticorruption-authority-anac) | [Integrity Authority](#hungarys-integrity-authority) |

It's an independent, non-political global organization for the agencies and
officials responsible for fighting corruption.

Established in 2006 in Beijing, China, the IAACA serves as a global network for
anti-corruption authorities (ACAs) worldwide.

The primary objective of the IAACA is to promote the effective implementation of
the [UNCAC](#united-nations-convention-against-corruption-uncac).

It functions as a central platform for anti-corruption authorities to
collaborate, share best practices, and support each other in the global fight
against corruption.

Unlike [Transparency International](#transparency-international) (an NGO) or
[GRECO](#group-of-states-against-corruption-greco) (a regional monitoring body),
the IAACA is a professional association for the anti-corruption bodies
themselves. Its main activities include:
- **promoting international cooperation**: facilitating direct cooperation
  between member agencies on practical matters, such as mutual legal assistance,
  asset recovery, and extradition;
- **exchanging expertise**: organizing annual conferences, general meetings, and
  specialized training workshops where prosecutors, investigators, and
  prevention specialists can share successful strategies and technical
  expertise;
- **capacity building**: assisting in the development and strengthening of
  anti-corruption authorities, particularly in developing countries;
- **networking**: creating a global network of anti-corruption professionals to
  foster direct and informal communication.

IAACA's membership is not composed of countries (like GRECO) but of the national
anti-corruption authorities (ACAs) themselves.

It brings together institutions responsible for investigation, prosecution, and
prevention of corruption from around the world.

The association has over 170 member agencies.

The Presidency and Secretariat are currently held by the Independent Commission
Against Corruption (ICAC) of Hong Kong SAR (Special Administrative Region),
China.

## Hungary's [Integrity Authority][ia]

<img src="assets/img/ia.png" alt="Logo" height="80px">

| 🇭🇺 |
| :-: |
| *Integritás Hatóság* |

It's an autonomous state administrative body established in 2022 with the
specific mandate to oversee the use of European Union funds in the country.

Its creation was a central part of a package of anti-corruption reforms demanded
by the European Commission. It was a key "remedial measure" intended to address
systemic rule-of-law *(stato di diritto)* and corruption concerns that had led
the EU to freeze billions of euros in cohesion and recovery funds designated for
Hungary.

The Authority officially began its operations on November 19, 2022.

The Integrity Authority's mission is not to act as a general, all-purpose
anti-corruption agency. Its mandate is strictly focused on protecting the EU's
financial interests.

Its main tasks include:
- **monitoring EU funds**: overseeing all planned, ongoing, or completed
  projects that receive partial or full funding from the European Union;
- **prevention and detection**: working to prevent, detect, and correct
  instances of fraud, conflicts of interest, corruption, and other legal
  irregularities related to the management of these funds;
- **conducting investigations**: it can initiate investigations based on its own
  findings or on reports and complaints from any person, including anonymous
  whistleblowers;
- **intervention powers**: the Authority has the power to:
  - instruct contracting authorities (like government agencies) to suspend
    public procurement procedures if it suspects wrongdoing;
  - request information and data from other state bodies;
  - issue binding recommendations and, if they are not followed, refer the
    matter to a court.
- **reporting**: it publishes annual integrity reports and risk assessments of
  Hungary's public procurement system;
- **referring cases**: it can refer suspected criminal cases to Hungarian law
  enforcement, the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), or the European Public
  Prosecutor's Office (EPPO) (which Hungary is not a member of, but the
  Authority can cooperate with).

The Authority's work is supported by an [Anti-Corruption Task
Force](#anti-corruption-task-force-kemcs).

### [Anti-Corruption Task Force][kemcs-en] *(KEMCS)*

<img src="assets/img/kemcs.png" alt="Logo" height="80px">

| 🇭🇺 |
| :-: |
| *Korrupcióellenes Munkacsoport* |

This is a consultative body chaired by the President of the [Integrity
Authority](#hungarys-integrity-authority), composed of 21 members—half from
government and state institutions, and half from non-governmental civil society,
including anti-corruption watchdogs like [Transparency
International](#transparency-international) Hungary.

It was established in December 2022.

Its official role is not to investigate or prosecute specific cases of
corruption. Instead, it operates for an indefinite time, carrying out
analytical, proposal, opinion-forming, and decision-preparation tasks.

Its main tasks include:
- analyzing the government's existing anti-corruption measures;
- developing proposals and recommendations to improve the prevention, detection,
  and sanctioning of corruption;
- preparing an annual report that assesses the state of corruption and the
  effectiveness of anti-corruption policies in Hungary.

## [Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development][oecd] (OECD)

<img src="assets/img/oecd.png" alt="Logo" height="80px">

| 🇮🇹 |
| :-: |
| *Organizzazione per la cooperazione e lo sviluppo economico (OCSE)* |

It's an international organization headquartered in Paris, France. It was
founded in 1961 to stimulate economic progress and world trade.

Its core mission is to shape policies that foster prosperity, equality,
opportunity, and well-being for all. It is often described as a "think tank" or
"club" for its 38 member countries, which are typically democracies with
market-based economies.

The OECD originated from the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation
(OEEC), which was formed in 1948 to help administer the Marshall Plan for the
reconstruction of Europe after World War II.

The OECD's primary role is to provide a forum where governments can work
together to share experiences, seek solutions to common problems, and develop
global standards.

Its main functions include:
- **policy analysis and advice**: it collects data, conducts research, and
  analyzes economic and social trends. Based on this evidence, it provides
  policy recommendations to its member countries on a vast range of topics;
- **setting international standards**: the organization develops agreed-upon
  international standards and guidelines to promote best practices. This
  includes work on issues like:
  - international tax (e.g., combating tax evasion and base erosion);
  - corporate governance;
  - anti-bribery and corruption;
  - environmental protection;
  - education (e.g., the PISA test);
  - artificial intelligence.
- **"peer reviews"**: it facilitates a process where one country's policies are
  reviewed by other member countries. This "peer pressure" encourages
  governments to improve their policies and learn from one another's successes
  and failures;
- **publishing reports**: it is a well-known publisher of economic data,
  forecasts, and statistical reports, such as its biannual Economic Outlook.

### [Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions][oecd-bribery-convention]

This agreement, commonly known as the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention, is the
primary international instrument designed to stop the bribery of foreign public
officials in global business deals.

The convention's central goal is to create a level playing field in
international business by making it a crime for companies and individuals to
bribe foreign public officials to obtain or retain business. It specifically
targets the "supply side" of bribery, that is the person or entity offering or
giving the bribe.

Countries that are parties to the convention are legally bound to implement its
standards into their domestic laws. Key requirements include:
- **criminalizing foreign bribery**: parties must make it a criminal offense for
  any person to intentionally offer, promise, or give an "undue pecuniary or
  other advantage" to a foreign public official to secure an improper advantage
  in international business;
- **corporate liability**: the convention mandates that companies (referred to
  as "legal persons") can be held responsible for the bribery of foreign public
  officials;
- **sanctions**: penalties for bribery must be "effective, proportionate, and
  dissuasive". For individuals, this must include criminal penalties (including
  potential imprisonment), and for companies, it must include significant
  monetary sanctions;
- **accounting and auditing**: parties must require companies to maintain
  accurate books and records, prohibiting practices like off-the-books accounts
  or "slush funds" *(fondi illeciti)* used to hide bribes;
- **mutual legal assistance**: signatory countries must provide prompt and
  effective legal assistance to one another in investigations and prosecutions
  related to the convention's offenses.

The convention is not just a signed document; its implementation is actively and
rigorously monitored by the OECD Working Group on Bribery (WGB). It's the body
responsible for monitoring all parties. It is composed of representatives from
all signatory countries. The WGB conducts a systematic, multi-phase peer-review
process to evaluate how well each member country is implementing and enforcing
the convention. The WGB publishes its detailed country reports, including
recommendations for legal and policy reforms. This "name and shame" (or "name
and praise") system creates significant political pressure on countries to
uphold their commitments.

The European Union budget finances a wide range of programmes and projects which
improve the lives of citizens across the EU and beyond. The improper use of
funds provided by the EU budget or the evasion of the taxes, duties and levies,
which fund the EU budget directly harms European citizens and prejudices the
entire European project.

OLAF fulfils its mission by:
- **carrying out independent investigations into fraud and corruption involving
  EU funds**, so as to ensure that all EU taxpayers' money reaches projects that
  can create jobs and growth in Europe;
- contributing to strengthening citizens' trust in the EU Institutions by
  investigating serious misconduct by EU staff and members of the EU
  Institutions;
- developing a sound EU anti-fraud policy.

## Cressey's fraud triangle

<img src="assets/img/cressey-fraud-triangle.png" alt="Fraud triangle" height="320px">

It's a fundamental model in criminology and accounting used to explain the
factors that cause an individual to commit occupational fraud[^3] *(frode sul
lavoro)*. It was developed based on the research of sociologist and
criminologist Dr. Donald R. Cressey in the 1950s.

Cressey's research, particularly his book "Other People's Money", studied
embezzlers (or "trust violators") and concluded that three specific factors must
be present for an ordinary, trusted person to commit fraud:
1. **pressure** (or incentive), this is the motivation or "non-shareable
   financial need" that drives the individual to act. The pressure is often
   something the person feels they cannot share with others, such as:
   - **financial difficulties**: mounting debts, medical bills, or gambling
     losses;
   - **work-related pressure**: feeling underpaid, being passed over for a
     promotion, or facing unrealistic performance targets;
   - **lifestyle-driven pressure**: a desire to maintain a lavish lifestyle that
     is beyond their means, or social pressure to appear successful.
2. **opportunity**, this refers to the individual's ability to commit the fraud.
   The person must perceive a clear chance to commit the act, conceal it, and
   avoid detection. Opportunities often arise from:
   - **weak internal controls**: lack of supervision, poor separation of duties
     (e.g., one person handles receiving, recording, and approving payments), or
     inadequate auditing;
   - **position of trust**: having access to sensitive information, assets, or
     systems that others do not;
   - **ineffective oversight**: a belief that "no one is watching" or that the
     company won't punish fraudulent behavior.
3. **rationalization**, this is the psychological component where the fraudster
   justifies their actions to themselves, allowing them to commit the crime
   without feeling like a criminal.

According to Cressey's theory, fraud is most likely to occur when all three of
these elements are present.

[^1]: Its the misappropriation when the property or funds involved have been
      lawfully entrusted to the embezzler. In circumstances where the funds are
      accessible to, but not entrusted to, the perpetrator, it is not
      embezzlement but can still be considered larceny, misappropriation,
      misapplication, or some other similar term.

[^2]: The practical process of creating, strengthening, and professionalizing
      the core institutions that a country needs to function effectively.

[^3]: The misuse of a person's job for personal enrichment through the
      deliberate misuse of company resources.
